# PYTHON---Data-Profiling-and-Analysis-of-Corporate-Investments-and-Acquisitions
**Project Summary: Data Profiling for Corporate Datasets**

This Python project involves performing data profiling on a given dataset to gain insights into corporate information. The dataset is provided in an Excel file and consists of four worksheets: COMPANY, INVESTMENT, ACQUISITION, and EMPLOYEE.

The COMPANY worksheet includes firmographics data such as company name, industry category, location, revenue range, and employee count. The INVESTMENT worksheet provides details about investments received by the companies, including funding type, amount raised, and investment stage. The ACQUISITION worksheet contains information about acquisitions made by the companies, including the name of the acquired company, announced date, price, and type of acquisition. The EMPLOYEE worksheet provides details about the employees working in the companies, including hashed unique IDs, job titles, company names, and attended schools.

Using the techniques, such as data inspection, cleaning, filtering, summarization, sorting, grouping, merging, reshaping, and plotting, this project aims to answer interesting questions about the dataset. Some examples of questions to explore are the number of companies that have received investments, the distribution of current company statuses, the average amount of money received at Series A round, the company with the highest number of acquisitions, and the companies with CEOs graduated from top schools.
